# AstroDataFeel
See, hear, move through astronomical data 

https://archive.stsci.edu/ hosts most of the data ever collected by NASA's astrophysical missions. These include space satellites like <i>Hubble</i>, <i>JWST</i> and <i>Gaia</i>, as well as the ground-based Pan-STARRS and VLA-FIRST surveys. Some missions, like the <i>Chandra X-ray Telescope</i> that I work for, choose to host their own data archive. This repository focuses on the STScI MAST archive because of the variety of missions and seamless integration with Python.
